# BNAF
Tensorflow Eager Execution implementation of Block Neural Autoregressive Flow based on:
> De Cao Nicola, Titov Ivan and Aziz Wilker, [Block Neural Autoregressive Flow](http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.04676) (2019)

## Requirements
* **``python>=3.6``** (it will probably work on older versions but I have not tested on them)

Optional for visualization and plotting: ``numpy``, ``matplotlib``

## Structure
* This has been adapted from the original to work with Tensorflow Eager Execution, improve optimization, fix some mistakes in the implementation, and eliminate things like normalization layers to help condense the articture to minimal size for embedded applications.

## Usage
Below, example commands are given for running experiments.
